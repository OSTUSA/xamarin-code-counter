# xamarin-code-counter
Calculates how much code is shared vs platform specific.

This is written in .Net Core and runs with Visual Studio for Mac (on Mac) and Visual Studio (on Windows).
At the moment, it only looks for Anroid and iOS projects when calculating platform-specific code. This can easily be extended to look for other project types.
